# Welcome To barq's File Repository
This is where I'm currently experimenting with filehosting and web development in general. I don't know if
I'll keep updating but I hope to make it into a portfolio of sort. I'm currently learning HTML, CSS, and JS,
as well as PHP and mySQL (though not terribly applicable here) and I'm treating this as a playground of sorts
for the moment. I was going to host this site myself but I'm afraid I'm not there yet (I actually think something's
wrong with my port-forwarding).

In any case! Welcome, and thanks for checking this out!
